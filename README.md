# MyVitality
Final Year Project

I was given a document containing company specifications and spreadsheets containg sample data.
From this I was tasked with:
-building an online store
-designing the database and importing the data
-building an admin side to manage the transactions within the system.

See Documenation folder for:
- written portfolio, design diagrams, screen shots of site
- manuals

See Database folder for SQL code
